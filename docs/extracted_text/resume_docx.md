**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Learning-Driven Optimization for  Aug 2025 -- Present

*Advisor: Asst. Prof. Guillaume Sartoretti (NUS)*

Focus: scalable learning in closed-loop decision-making for multi-agent
robotic routing and task allocation.

-   Built a Transformer-based PARCO framework to generate diverse
    Pareto-optimal solution sets for multi-objective routing.

-   Implemented multi-agent RL with sparse rewards and transformer-based
    inter-agent communication for cooperative decision-making.

-   Evaluated against NSGA-III/MOEA baselines with Pareto-front
    analysis, showing strong hypervolume and fast inference.

Relevance: data-driven optimization under multi-objective trade-offs,
emphasizing generalization and reliability.

-   Achieved zero-shot generalization across arbitrary problem sizes via
    conditional attention and a conditional encoder.

-   Proposed a decoupled dual decoder (agent selection / node selection)
    to remove input-dimension constraints and improve scalability.

-   Enhanced REINFORCE with dynamic sampling; improved hypervolume and
    reduced inference time from hours to seconds.
