-   Project Overview: Addressed the generalization challenge in
    Multi-Objective MTSP by proposing CAMO, a general neural solver that
    achieves Zero-shot Generalization across arbitrary problem scales
    using a conditional attention mechanism

-   Architecture Design: Innovated a Conditional Encoder to efficiently
    fuse multi-objective preferences and pioneered a decoupled
    Agent/Node-selection Dual Decoder. This architecture breaks input
    dimension constraints, enabling dual scalability on unseen problem
    sizes

-   Performance Optimization: Enhanced the REINFORCE algorithm with a
    dynamic sampling strategy. Experiments demonstrated superior
    Hypervolume performance compared to baselines (NSGA-III, MOEA/D),
    reducing inference time from hours to seconds with visualized Pareto
    Front analysis

-   Architected a learning-driven optimization framework for the
    Multi-Objective Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MOMTSP),
    leveraging a Transformer-based Parallel AutoRegressive (PARCO) model
    to efficiently construct high-quality solution sets

-   Implemented a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy
    with sparse rewards, enabling agents to autonomously learn complex,
    cooperative decision-making policies and derive effective routing
    strategies from minimal feedback

-   Engineered a novel parallel solution construction mechanism by
    integrating a Transformer-based communication for agent
    collaboration, a multiple pointer mechanism for low-latency
    decision-making, and learned priority-based handlers to
    systematically resolve agent conflicts

-   Validated the superiority of the proposed method by visualizing the
    derived optimal policies on a Pareto front and conducting rigorous
    comparative analysis against recognized industry baselines,
    confirming the model\'s high performance and credibility

-   Pioneered the application of the PARCO framework to a
    multi-objective problem, demonstrating its robustness and
    adaptability in generating a diverse set of Pareto-optimal solutions
    for complex, multi-agent combinatorial tasks

-   Control Protocol Design: Designed a prescribed-time time-varying
    formation control protocol for second-order multi-agent systems.
    Constructed Lyapunov functions to rigorously prove system stability
    and ensure convergence within a pre-set time

-   Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM): Developed a Neural Network-based
    adaptive ETM for leader-follower structures. Utilized NNs to
    dynamically adjust triggering thresholds, significantly reducing
    inter-agent communication bandwidth while maintaining formation
    accuracy

-   Simulation & Validation: Implemented high-fidelity simulations in
    MATLAB/Simulink. Solved high-order dynamics using Runge-Kutta
    (ode45) and validated the system\'s robustness against communication
    noise and external disturbances

    Graduation Design Competition for UAV Engineering* and **Second

    undersampling to address imbalanced classes
